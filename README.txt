Retro Snake Game
by Cristian Saguil

Technologies used:
-JavaScript
-HTML5 Canvas

Usage Instructions:
- The game is hosted at the following url <https://csaguil.github.io/snake/>
- To run the game locally, you can host it on your own machine using
http-server <https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server>
- you can also simply open index.html in any modern web browser, however
the high score saving feature may not work depending on your cookie settings

Summary of features:
- High score saving - stored in browser cookies
- Ability to easily resize game screen, snake start length, and block size
(the size of a single square), just update the size variables

Things I would implement next:
- Difficulty levels (different speeds)
- Improved UI design including a better splash page and game over screen
